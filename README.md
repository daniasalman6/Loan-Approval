# A Data-driven Study Of Loan Approval

Access to credit is one of the key drivers of economic growth, yet not every applicant is granted a loan. Understanding how financial institutions make loan approval decisions can offer valuable insights into fairness, efficiency, and risk assessment in lending. With data-driven analysis, we can explore the relationship between applicants’ personal and financial characteristics and their likelihood of receiving approval.
The goal of this project is to identify the main factors that influence loan approval decisions using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset has 4269 observations with 13 variables and includes CIBIL score (a credit score ranging from 300 to 900 issued by the Indian Credit Bureau, with a higher score indicating better creditworthiness), asset value (the total amount of the applicant's real estate and deposits), loan term (measured in years, ranging from 1 to 20 years), and other variables (such as educational level, employment status, etc). Through exploratory and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns that explain approval outcomes and provide a clearer picture of how various factors impact lending decisions.

3. Is there a significant difference in average income between approved and rejected applicants?
4. Is there a significant difference in average CIBIL scores between approved and rejected applicants?
5. Is there a correlation between applicant's annual income and loan amount requested?
6. Do people with higher asset values tend to get approved more often?
7. Does the number of dependents affect approval of loans?
8. Does requested loan term affect approval?
9. For rejected loans, is there a significant difference in the mean CIBIL score between applicants with shorter loan term loans (<=10 years) versus longer term loans(>10 years)?
10. Is there a correlation between the CIBIL Score and the Loan Term among those whose loans are approved?
